"""
Drives scripts/changelog-released-immutable.py against synthetic fixtures (core#231). Ported
from vivijure-cf tests/changelog-released-immutable.test.py (cf#551 piece 2), itself ported in
mechanism from the CHANGELOG IMMUTABILITY block of tests/render-wrangler.test.sh in
vivijure-control-plane (cp#219, cp#245).

INVOKED VIA SUBPROCESS, NOT IMPORTED. The script under test executes at MODULE LEVEL and calls
sys.exit() directly, the same shape as the original in vivijure-control-plane, ported unchanged (see
the docstring of that script for why), so importing it here would exit this test process on the
first import. Every check below runs the real script as a subprocess against a synthetic git
repository built in a tempdir, the same way .github/workflows/changelog.yml runs it.

THE FIXTURE IS THE POINT, same discipline as tests/changelog-entry-required.test.ts. build_repo()
constructs a repository with two released, tagged sections and an empty Unreleased heading, then
each check makes its own throwaway copy (a fresh .git plus a hand-edited CHANGELOG.md and
corrections file) so a mutation in one check cannot leak into another.

THE LAST SECTION is not a synthetic fixture: it runs the shipped guard against vivijure-core as
actually checked out, and cross-checks the result against an independently written re-derivation of
the same "does a released section still match its tag" question, so this is not the script grading
its own homework. It is a self-consistency check, not a hardcoded violation count, so it stays valid
whether main currently has known drift (core#231 port-time measurement: v1.18.0, v1.13.0, v1.3.0)
or has since been cleaned up.
