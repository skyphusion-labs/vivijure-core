// Durable record of a RunPod job this estate submitted (cf#279, cf#284, cf#288, cf#298, cf#320,
// cf#475). THE CANONICAL IMPLEMENTATION -- everything else re-exports it.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS LIVES IN CORE AND NOT IN THE HOST. This file was written in vivijure-cf under
// modules/_shared/, because at the time only MODULE WORKERS submitted to RunPod: migration
// 0014_runpod_job_log.sql says so in as many words ("the CORE no longer submits to RunPod at all").
// That premise stopped being true when cast LoRA training moved into core. cast-lora-train.ts
// submits to RunPod directly, on the studio Worker, through runpod-submit.ts, and it could not
// reach a recorder that lived downstream of it in the dependency graph.
//
// The measured consequence is cf#475: vivijure-wan-train billed 14.5% of GPU spend on 2026-08-01 and
// 21.9% on 2026-08-02 with ZERO rows in runpod_job_log on either day. Not mis-attributed. Absent.
// And absent in the flattering direction -- every row that IS present is correct, so a total built
// on this table reads clean and is simply low.
//
// The fix is the one cp#321 already ruled for runpod-route.ts, applied to the same shape: move the
// implementation into core, have both sides IMPORT it, do NOT write a second one. There were
// already two copies before this move (vivijure-cf modules/_shared/runpod-job-log.ts and
// vivijure-local src/runpod-job-log.ts) and they had ALREADY DRIFTED -- measured 2026-08-15, local
// still carries DETAIL_MAX = 160 (the exact truncation cf#320 raised to 480), lacks the `unknown`
// outcome added by cf#298, and has no timing columns at all. Two copies of one rule is not a
// hypothetical failure mode here; it is the state we are in.
//
// THE ONE HARD GUARANTEE, unchanged by the move: this helper never throws, never rejects, and never
// delays its caller by more than RUNPOD_JOB_LOG_TIMEOUT_MS. It is telemetry attached to a
// soft-degrade path, and a telemetry failure that converted a soft degrade into a hard failure would
// be strictly worse than the gap it closes. Every exit is a warn plus a return.
//
// WHY THE BINDING IS OPTIONAL. A host deployed without the database must still work: the studio runs
// in several shapes and a dangling binding is a deploy failure, not a degrade. But an absent binding
// must never be INDISTINGUISHABLE from a clean run, which is the exact failure shape cf#277 is
// about, so absence warns with its own marker and the /ready probe reports it as three states.
//
// CONTENT-FREE: the caller supplies a RunPod job id, a compile-time module name, an outcome from a
// closed union, and (on a fault) the backend error text bounded to DETAIL_MAX. Nothing here reads
// user input, and the RunPod endpoint id is deliberately not a column (see cf migrations/0014).
//
// TYPED AGAINST THE PLATFORM Database, NOT D1Database. Same structural surface (prepare / bind /
// run / all / first), so every existing D1 call site passes unchanged; it is what lets vivijure-local
// eventually retire its own copy against the same code rather than a same-looking one.

 * dcbaaa55-d64d-4f0b-8a4a-002b149c99cc-e2 ran to completion, wrote its keyframe to R2, and RunPod

 * spend-leak cancel and the core cancel path), so without this value a deliberately-cancelled job is
 * neither a success nor a failure nor an open job -- it is simply missing from the arithmetic.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE ASSUMING cf#286 WAS OVERRULED. cf#286 and cf#288 both explicitly REFUSED a
 * `cancelled` value, and they were right about what they were refusing: it was proposed there as the
 * home for a DELIBERATE REFUSAL, and a refusal never becomes CANCELLED (a raise inside the handler
 * propagates and the SDK books the job FAILED), so it would have named the wrong thing and never
 * fired for its stated purpose. That reasoning is untouched. Refusals are discriminated by

// chars, and it survives only because `error_type` happens to be the first key emitted -- 87
// characters of headroom against a vendor reordering its own JSON, with a silent failure mode.
//
// THE THREE SATELLITE ENDPOINTS EMIT NO error_type AT ALL. musetalk, video-upscale and

// READINESS (cf#284): can this worker actually RECORD, not merely is a binding attached.
//
// GET /ready used to report Boolean(env.TELEMETRY_DB), which is the presence of the BINDING. A
// worker bound to a real database where runpod_job_log does not exist reported job_log:true while
// being structurally incapable of writing a row, and that is not hypothetical: it was observed in
// the v1.13.0 pre-tag smoke, with a job running to completion while both writes failed. A probe that
// cannot distinguish a missing table from a working one reintroduces, one layer up, the exact defect
// the job log exists to end -- an empty log being indistinguishable from a clean run.
//
// THREE STATES, NOT A BOOLEAN, and that is the whole point. A boolean has nowhere to put I COULD NOT
// TELL, so it answers it as one of the two real states, and the safe-looking one is the lie:
//
//   ok           a read against runpod_job_log succeeded: the table is there and reachable
//   unavailable  DEFINITIVELY cannot record: no binding at all, or the table does not exist
//   unknown      the probe itself could not answer (the read threw, or it outran the timeout)
//
// unknown is NOT ok. An operator reading unknown knows the probe failed; an operator reading a true
// that was produced by a failed probe knows nothing and believes something.
//
// WHY A READ AND NOT A WRITE. A readiness probe must not leave litter, and a probe that inserts a row
// would put fabricated jobs in the very table operators query for real ones. A read costs one round
// trip on a path that was previously free, which is the tradeoff cf#284 raised: taken deliberately,
// because /ready is called before flipping a tenant live, and a free answer to the wrong question is
// worth less than a cheap answer to the right one.
//
// HONEST LIMIT, stated because the name invites more than it proves: this establishes the table is
// READABLE, not that an INSERT would succeed. A read-only replica or a constraint failure would
// still report ok. It closes the observed hole (missing table) and does not claim to close every one.
//
// WHY NOT CLASSIFY THE ERROR TEXT. Reading no such table out of an error message would be a parser
// only as fresh as the vendor string it was built from. sqlite_master answers the same question
// structurally: a row or no row, nothing to match. The distinction is decided by data, not by prose.
