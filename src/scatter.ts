// Distributed scatter/gather render conductor (pure core).
//
// A normal render runs every shot in one RunPod job. A *scatter* render splits
// the storyboard across N jobs that run in parallel, then *gathers* their
// per-shot clips into one MP4. The win is wall-clock: a 10-shot film that takes
// ~T on one worker takes ~T/N across N, at the same GPU-second cost.
//
// Three things make this safe and cheap, and they already exist on the backend:
//   1. `process_shot_ids` lets a job render only its slice (orchestrator.plan
//      scopes scenes to it).
//   2. `pretrained_loras` lets every shard REUSE the character adapters trained
//      ONCE up front (handler._stage_pretrained_loras pulls them from R2), so a
//      shard never retrains, and every shot shares byte-identical identity.
//   3. `finish_offloaded` makes a shard emit per-shot clips + a manifest and
//      skip the merge, so the control plane owns the single final assembly.
//
// This module is the CONDUCTOR's pure logic: how to split the shots, how to
// shape each shard's submit args, and how to decide when the gather can finish.
// No I/O, no Worker runtime: trivially unit-testable. The orchestration that
// submits jobs, writes the parent/child `renders` rows, and drives the merge
// lives in index.ts and reuses these helpers plus the gather core already in
// video-finish.ts (gatherClipPresence / finishInputFromClipKeys / runVideoFinish).

// storyboard order. Balanced with a front-loaded remainder, so 10 shots over 3
// shards => [4, 3, 3], never an empty trailing shard.
//
// `shardCount` is clamped to [1, shots.length]: asking for more shards than
// shots would mint empty jobs (GPU-seconds for nothing), and asking for <1 is
